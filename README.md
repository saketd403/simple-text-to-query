# Convert your natural language questions to SQL queries
Welcome to simple-text-to-query! This project demonstrates how to leverage OpenAI's ChatGPT as well as a local LLM to convert natural language text into SQL queries using SQLite3.

# Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that showcases a practical approach to translating natural language into SQL queries. By integrating ChatGPT with SQLite3, users can input natural language text and receive corresponding SQL queries that can be executed against an SQLite database.

# Features
- Natural Language Processing: Utilizes ChatGPT to understand and convert user queries written in plain language.
- SQLite3 Integration: Executes the generated SQL queries on an SQLite3 database.
- Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for experimentation and learning.
